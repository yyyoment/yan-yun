My personal website: https://yyyoment.github.io/yan-yun/

My main purpose of making this website is to create a nesting platform to display all my previous works(write-ups, codes and online apps) to the recruiters and show my capacity and creativity since I am currently a graduate student who is seeking full-time job. I wish I can come up with more high-quality data analysis in the future.

Moreover, It was a lot of fun tweaking the HTML. During the process of making this site, I learned a lot about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Knowing the structure of websites better, I am now able to scrape websites more efficiently and beautify my Rmarkdown and Jupyter HTML output.

What's more, I embedded the Google Analytics in my site and tried to monitor my site traffic, which greatly deepens my understanding towards the tool as well as the market analytics concept.

Hope you enjoy it:)
